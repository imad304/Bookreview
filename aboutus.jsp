Online book review managment system came in existance because lot off books 
are not reaching the people interest.In existing system, publisher will
publish the book without considering the views of user.so this system came into
existance in this the publisher vil publish the book and upload the bookreview 
in this website people may give feedback,rating to that book according to the 
user interest by this the publisher will know the user interest and he will
decide to publish the book into market or not by this the publisher can save 
the money.</p>
